This code aimed to verify that the retroaction of the variation of hbar onto the equation of state of the star has almost no impact.

To launch the codes, you first need to install the packages present in the file ...

After that, you have to open a terminal in the folder that contains the codes and, in an appropriate environment, you write :

" python3 Get_all_figures.py " 

This line will launch the code, the duration is a few minutes at most. It will lead to the production of three different things.

- Two folders, one contains the stored data of the predicted values of hbar ("hbar_folder") and the other the stored data of the radius of the star ("radius_folder"). These contain the values with and without the retroaction.
- A figure named "hbar_variation_comparison_NS.png", which shows the variation of hbar versus the distance to the star in both cases. It is figure 5 in the paper.
