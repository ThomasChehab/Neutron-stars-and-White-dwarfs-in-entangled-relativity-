Entangled Relativity is based on a f($R,\mathcal{L}_m$) action in four dimensions, where spacetime and matter are coupled multiplicatively. This theory possesses General Relativity as a limit and is more "parsimonious". Indeed, it requires one fewer parameter to be formulated. This modification results in numerous surprising and intriguing phenomenon. One of these, is the prediction of variation of the Planck constant $\hbar$ near compact objects. Additionally, it directly implies the Mach principle through the coupling between spacetime and matter. The code is link to the paper '' Variation of the Planck constant in the sky '' published by Olivier Minazzoli and Thomas Chehab. 

This code aims at computing the variation of the Planck constant near compact object in the context of entangled relativity. All necessary package are available in the file '' ''.

Instruction to launch the code are available in the file '' '' that are directly into the folder " Neutron_Star_codes" and "White_Dwarfs_codes".
