#Neutron-stars-and-White-dwarfs-in-entangled-relativity-
Entangled relativity is a recent theory of gravity based on a f($R,\mathcal{L}_m$) action in four dimensions, where spacetime and matter are coupled multiplicatively, whereas in general relativity, the coupling is purely additive. 

These codes model white dwarfs and neutron star in entangled relativity and especially they aims at studying the variation of the Planck constant as predicted by the theory.
These codes aims at providing the figures 5 and 6 of the paper ... Written by Olivier Minazolli, Thomas Chehab and (?).
