This code aimed to study the variation of hbar predicted by the theory regarding the value of the core density.

To launch the codes, you first need to install the packages present in the file ...

After you have to launch a terminal into the folder that contains the codes and, in an appropriate environment, you write : 

" python3 Get_all_figures.py " 

This line will launch the code, the duration is a few minutes at most. It will lead to the production of four different things.

- Three folders : one contains the stored data of the predicted values of hbar ("hbar_folder"), another contain the stored data of the radius of the star ("radius_folder") and the last one contains the core density values ("init_density_folder"). These contain the values for 250 different white dwarf simulation.
- A figure named "deltahbar_vs_radius_WD.png", which shows the variation of hbar versus the distance to the star regarding the core density values. It is figure 6 in the paper.
